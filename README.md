## 🔧 How It Works

### The Algorithm

1. **Input Collection**
   - Service name (e.g., Facebook, Gmail)
   - Username/Email
   - Account number (optional)
   - Secret key (minimum 8 characters)

2. **Hash Generation**
   ```
   Multiple SHA-256 hashes with different salt combinations
   ↓
   PBKDF2 key derivation (1,000 iterations)
   ↓
   Custom character mixing algorithm
   ↓
   Strong password output
   ```

3. **Password Construction**
   - First character: Always a letter (A-Z or a-z)
   - Guaranteed minimum of 2 uppercase letters
   - Guaranteed minimum of 2 lowercase letters
   - Guaranteed minimum of 2 numbers
   - Guaranteed minimum of 2 special symbols
   - Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm (preserving first letter)
   - Position-based character transformations

4. **Deterministic Output**
   - Same inputs ALWAYS generate the same password
   - No randomness - pure mathematical computation
   - Reproducible across any device or browser

## 📥 Installation

### Option 1: Direct Use (Recommended)

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No installation required!

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ahm3d0x/smart-password-generator.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd smart-password-generator

# Open in browser
# Double-click index.html or use a local server
```

### Option 2: Local Server

For best experience, use a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (http-server)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Option 3: Deploy to Web

Deploy to any static hosting service:
- GitHub Pages
- Vercel
- Netlify

## 🔐 Security Details

### Why is This Secure?

1. **Zero Storage**
   - No data is ever saved to disk, cookies, or cloud
   - Everything exists in memory only during active session
   - Automatic memory clearing on page close

2. **Deterministic Generation**
   - Mathematical computation, not random generation
   - Same inputs = Same password (always)
   - No need to "save" passwords

3. **Strong Cryptography**
   - SHA-256: Industry-standard cryptographic hash function
   - PBKDF2: Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2
   - 100,000+ iterations for key strengthening
   - Multiple salt layers

4. **Client-Side Only**
   - All computation happens in your browser
   - No server communication
   - No data transmission
   - No tracking or analytics

5. **Password Complexity**
   - Minimum 16 characters
   - Mixed character types guaranteed
   - High entropy (randomness)
   - Resistant to brute-force attacks

### Security Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Use a strong, unique secret key (master password)
- Write down your secret key in a secure physical location
- Use different account numbers for different instances
- Keep your input combinations private

❌ **DON'T:**
- Share your secret key with anyone
- Use weak or common secret keys (e.g., "12345678")
- Forget your secret key (it cannot be recovered)
- Use this on public/shared computers without clearing browser history

### Threat Model

**Protected Against:**
- ✅ Data breaches (no data stored)
- ✅ Server-side attacks (no server)
- ✅ Password database leaks (no database)
- ✅ Rainbow table attacks (salted hashing)
- ✅ Brute force attacks (strong complexity)

**Not Protected Against:**
- ❌ Shoulder surfing (someone watching you type)
- ❌ Keyloggers (malware on your device)
- ❌ Phishing attacks (fake websites)
- ❌ Physical compromise of your device

### Key Functions

```javascript
// Main password generation
async function generateSecurePassword(serviceName, username, account, secretKey, minLength)

// SHA-256 hashing
async function sha256(str)

// String shuffling (Fisher-Yates)
function shuffleString(str, bytes)

// Strength calculation
function showStrength(password)
```

### Password Generation Algorithm

```
Input: serviceName, username, account, secretKey
Output: 16+ character strong password

Step 1: Create salted combinations
  combined1 = salt1 + serviceName + username + account + secretKey + salt2
  combined2 = secretKey + salt3 + serviceName + username + salt1
  combined3 = account + username + secretKey + serviceName + salt2

Step 2: Generate SHA-256 hashes
  hash1 = SHA256(combined1)
  hash2 = SHA256(combined2)
  hash3 = SHA256(combined3)

Step 3: Apply PBKDF2 simulation
  derivedKey = hash1
  FOR i = 0 TO 1000:
    derivedKey = SHA256(derivedKey + hash2 + i + hash3)

Step 4: Convert to bytes
  bytes[] = hexToBytes(derivedKey)

Step 5: Build password
  password[0] = LETTER (uppercase or lowercase)
  password[1-2] = UPPERCASE
  password[3-4] = LOWERCASE
  password[5-6] = NUMBERS
  password[7-8] = SYMBOLS
  password[9-15] = MIXED

Step 6: Shuffle (preserve first character)
  firstChar = password[0]
  restShuffled = FisherYatesShuffle(password[1-15])
  password = firstChar + restShuffled

Step 7: Apply transformations
  FOR each character (except first):
    IF byte % 3 == 0 AND isLowercase:
      toUppercase
    IF byte % 5 == 0 AND isUppercase:
      toLowercase

Step 8: Final validation
  IF first character is not letter:
    Replace with letter

RETURN password
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Absolutely! Nothing is ever stored. All computation happens in your browser's memory and is cleared when you close the page.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: Yes! After the first load (to fetch TailwindCSS), you can use it offline. Consider saving the HTML file locally.

**Q: Will I get the same password on different devices?**
A: Yes! As long as you enter the exact same inputs (service name, username, account, secret key), you'll get the identical password on any device.

**Q: What if I forget my secret key?**
A: Unfortunately, there's no way to recover it. The secret key is not stored anywhere. This is a security feature, not a bug.

**Q: Can I change my password for a service?**
A: Yes! Simply change any of the inputs (e.g., add a number to the account field) and generate a new password.

### Security Questions

**Q: How secure is this compared to password managers?**
A: It's different. Traditional password managers store encrypted passwords. This generates passwords on-the-fly using cryptography. Both are secure if used properly.

**Q: Can someone crack my password?**
A: With 16+ characters and mixed character types, brute-forcing would take millions of years with current technology. However, a weak secret key reduces security significantly.

**Q: Why doesn't it save my passwords?**
A: This is intentional! By not storing anything, there's nothing to hack, leak, or lose. It's "unhackable storage."

**Q: What if the website goes down?**
A: Save the `index.html` file to your device. It works completely offline!

### Technical Questions

**Q: Can I inspect the code?**
A: Absolutely! The entire application is open-source and contained in a single HTML file. Feel free to audit it.

**Q: Does it work on mobile?**
A: Yes! The interface is fully responsive and works great on smartphones and tablets.

**Q: Can I integrate this into my app?**
A: Yes! You can extract the core password generation functions and use them in your own projects (respecting the MIT license).

**Q: Why does password generation take time?**
A: The 1-second delay is intentional for UX. The actual computation happens in milliseconds, but we show a loading state for better user experience.
